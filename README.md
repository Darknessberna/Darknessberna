- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darknessberna and I'm from Mexico 
- 👀 I am interested in creating something to support the Latin American community
- 🌱 I am currently learning to program in C at school where I am studying a technical degree in software development.
- 💞️ I am looking to join the community of programmers, I would really like to meet people with similar tastes to mine, although it does not matter if we have different tastes, and continue learning...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love food, my favorite dishes are chilaquiles and mole. 
     In my free time I like to play video games.
